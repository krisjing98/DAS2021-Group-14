A: country_of_origin    
B: aroma                
C: flavor               
D: acidity              
E: category_two_defects 
F: altitude_mean_meters 
G: harvested            
H: Qualityclass(response)

## about missing data
drop 1 missing data in column A; 
replace the missing values in column F by average;
ignore the column G

## relationship between H and B,C,D
good quality-> higher aroma grade, flavor grade and scidity grade

## relationship between H and E
good quality-> more category_two_defects 

## relationship between H and F
good quality-> slightly higher altitude
very weak relationship between F and B C D E-> altitude will not have contribution in collinearity-> suggest to keep it in the model fitting part

## relationship between H and G
no obvious relationship-> suggest to drop it in the model fitting part
